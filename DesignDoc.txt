= SPACE CHESS ==

Like regular chess, but in SPAAAAAAAAAAAACE!

(Please ignore the placeholder assets. They will be replaced with cool, thematically
appropriate spaceships later in the term.)

Networking implementation will be relatively simple. The game is limited to two players,
obviously. When one player moves a piece, a simple message is sent to the server:

[Tentative.Pseudocode]
class ChessMessage
{
	int pieceMoved;
	int newXcoordinate;
	int newYcoordinate;
}

The server then relays this message to the other player's client, which updates the
game board accordingly.

The current build (milestone 1) is set up for hotseat-style local multiplayer (two
players taking turns with the same mouse).

Most of the mechanics of real chess have been implemented. The pieces all move the
way they're supposed to; pieces can capture enemy pieces; each player's pieces are locked
(non-clickable) during the other player's turn.

The following major features still need to be implemented:
	-Check detection
	-Checkmate detection
	-Castling
